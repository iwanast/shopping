📂 The Brief: Create an API with MongoDB and Express for a shopping store online where
- there is at least one way for customers to interact with their new API
- customers should be able to find available products
- customers should be able to create a shopping cart
- it should be possible to create an order with a shopping cart AND a single item
- workers at the store should be able to mark orders as packed and shipped

⏳ Time spent / Deadline: Four weeks module

🎯 Goal: Learning data interactions and setting up an API, learning MongoDB and Express and more react.js

🦾 The working process: First I decided upon the structur of the database and what would be needed for the project on paper. Then I set-up the basic structure for the shop-app and the backend running on the Server. I implementet the different features step by step and used Hooks such as State, Effect, Context and Reducer for the frontend. I developed a basic REST API for the backend.

🎧 The projects content: A basic online-shop for second-hand books in react.js and API with node and Express, leveraging MongoDB as database.
